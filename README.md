First of all I recommend changing your console color, for the best visual experience. If you don't know how follow the pictures bellow.
1. Right click.
2. Choose properties.
3. Go to color menu.
4. Select Background color.
5. Choose white color from the pallete.
6. Click OK / Finish
7. Now following the same steps change the TEXT Color to black

Personally I am aware of three different variantions of the rules, so if you play by a different rules, please understand.
The code of the game is basic implementation of the most importand rules and bonuses, there is much more to be implemented, so the game can be fully realistic.
Many on the bonuses are not here, but the most common are here
1. 10 J Q (K) (K A)
2. (10) J Q K (A)
3. (9 10) (10) Q K A
I suggest to read the rules first, if you don't know them. - https://belot.bg/belot/rules/
